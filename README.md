## [Project 1: RFM Analysis of Retail Sales Data](https://github.com/albinaglv/RFM_Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
This project focuses on performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on an anonymised retail store sales transactions dataset. Using SQL Server, I analysed transactional data to uncover customer behavior patterns and develop strategies to improve customer retention. The project involved segmenting customers based on their purchasing habits and providing actionable insights to optimize marketing efforts.
