## [Project 1: RFM Analysis of Retail Sales Data](https://github.com/albinaglv/RFM_Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
This project focuses on performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on an anonymised retail store sales transactions dataset. Using SQL Server, I analysed transactional data to uncover customer behavior patterns and develop strategies to improve customer retention. The project involved segmenting customers based on their purchasing habits and providing actionable insights to optimise marketing efforts.

## [Project 2: Restaurant Orders Analysis](https://github.com/albinaglv/Restaurant-Orders-Analysis)
In this project, I analysed restaurant order data for Taste of the World Caf√© from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023, using MySQL. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into menu performance and customer preferences after a new menu launch at the beginning of the year. By examining order trends, peak times, and item popularity, I provided actionable insights to help optimise menu offerings and enhance customer satisfaction.
